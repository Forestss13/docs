### **REST API**

\*\*production environment: \*\*[**https://api.xt.com**](https://api.xt.com)

### **Basic information of the interface**

Due to reasons such as high latency and poor stability, it is not recommended to access the API through a proxy.

GET request parameters are placed in query Params, POST request parameters are placed in request body

Please set the request header information toï¼šContent-Type=application/json

For requests that start other than /public, the request message needs to be signed

### **Frequency Limiting Rules**

Some interfaces will have limited flow control (the corresponding interface will have a limited flow description). The flow limit is mainly divided into gateway flow limit and WAF flow limit.

If the interface request triggers the gateway flow limit, 429 will be returned, indicating that the access frequency exceeds the limit, and the IP or apiKey will be blocked.

Gateway flow limiting is divided into IP and apiKey flow limiting.

Example description of IP flow limit: 100/s/ip, indicating the limit of the number of requests per second for this interface per IP.

apiKey current limit example description: 50/s/apiKey, indicating the limit of the number of requests per second for the interface per apiKey.
